terra
=======

An abstraction library for storing and comparing geospatial data. Inspired by ESRI's Terraformer (http://github.com/Esri/Terraformer) and Terraformer Geostore (https://github.com/Esri/terraformer-geostore).

It relies on GoGeos (http://github.com/paulsmith/gogeos/geos) for geometry and RTreeGo (http://github.com/dhconnelly/rtreego) to index a persistent LevelDB cache (http://github.com/syndtr/goleveldb/leveldb).

Status
-----
Still in active development. I'll upload the godocs as soon as stable.
